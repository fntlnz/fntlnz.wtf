I don't often do things which require a blog but this time I came with something **very touching**.

I've been a Go developer for quite a long time now, I remember younger myself trying to understand
channels back in 2012 and while I was growing up also the language was.

<br>

So, dear Go, I think that **we grew up together**. Sort of.

<br>
And, dear Go, we have a lot in common, like:

- I like concurrent programming, you make it possible, easily
- moby, linuxkit, containerd, runc, cri-o, kubernetes, hugo and many other projects that are sooper interesting are written in you!
- The community around you is very helpful and smart and welcoming with everyone and, while I'm not exactly a people person I enjoy every moment.
- You have [support for 32-bit MIPS](https://golang.org/doc/go1.8#ports) processors, and I have a few R3000 chipsets. I [waited for this](https://twitter.com/fntlnz/status/700734565967667200) for a loong time. Also because setting up a cross compiler for mips32 is a **major PITA**.
- In my experience, you compile really fast and I'm not very patient. My grandma always says *"Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today"* - with you I don't even have to think about that because you already compiled my source code! [No slacking off!](https://www.xkcd.com/303/)
- [Even internally](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/sha256/sha256.go) you're easy to understand and simple, and I like simple things


<br>
Anyway, let's stop digressions and let's go straight **to the thing**.

Today I elaborated this Manifesto:

- Every Go developer needs her/his own Gopher representation
- Individuals and interactions between Gophers
- Attaching Gopher stickers over following a plan
- Working software and cute Gophers over comprehnsive Godoc


With this in mind and while being perfectly aware of my actions and of the fact that Gophers are cute, I started drawing
a Gopher that could represent myself.

## Finding an idea

An idea is fundamental, everything is driven by an idea and my Gopher couldn't have been less.

At this point I started looking at my old avatar, [The Old Man](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Old_Man),
and KABOOOOOOM.

<br>
It says:

> It's dangerous to **GO** alone! Take this

<br>
There's no need to waste applauses! Thank you!

## Sketches

After a few hours of complimenting with myself for the idea I started drawing some sketches for my Gopher,
I'm actually very bad ad drawing (I'm good at ideas though) and this was my best.

## Polishing

I obviously opted for grid paper to draw (because I'm n00b at drawing, but good at ideas) and that needed some love in post-production.

- I started by increasing contrast using Gimp

- Then I imported the image into Inkscape and used the "Trace Bitmap" tool

That tool is just Magic!

## Finishing up and coloring

After all the polishing I had to remove all the guidelines I drew for proportions and after some shape arranging and coloring
here's the result!

It's nothing special but now I have something unique I created and the Gryffindor house got 5 points because
today I did something different than just coding and my girlfriend had fun too and the whole SVG [it's open source](https://github.com/fntlnz/gopher-avatar)!

Bye!
