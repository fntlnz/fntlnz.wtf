### :rainbow: My home on the interwebs

Here you are in my personal little place on the internet where I share thoughts, ideas and findings.

I'm a member of the leenux fanclub by night and an SRE at [InfluxData](https://www.influxdata.com/) by day.

I don't remember the exact moment in which I wrote my first line of code but the Wayback Machine dates
my first website at March 2004, I was eleven and I remember my parents saying "Don't waste your nights at that PC",
well I never stopped.
